                        At Friend Fusion, conversations start spontaneously as users are randomly placed into chat rooms. Every 5 minutes, a voting session occurs, allowing users to provide feedback on their chat experience. To initiate a voting session, there must be more than two users in the room.

                        This system ensures that users who engage in harassment, disruptive behavior, or persistently discuss unwanted topics can be removed from the chat. By maintaining a respectful and enjoyable environment, Friend Fusion helps foster meaningful interactions and a positive community experience. Join us to be part of a dynamic and secure space where every conversation is a new opportunity to connect!
